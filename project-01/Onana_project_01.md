# Data Visualization

## Project 1
The purpose of this project is to summarize and visualize the data selected for this project (rats_nyc.csv). This data set contains lots of missing values but can still be used to showcase how different parts of Newyork is affected by rats. 
Plot 1: 
Based on the rat invasions in Newyork, how many Commercial buildings are active, non active or pending. By filtering the location type by Commercial Building and selecting the data i'm curious about which is status, i was able to use ggplot to create a bar graph that perfectly create a visual representation of the summary. There are 2 Assigned, 13 closed and 5 pending	
Plot 2: 
Here i was more interested in visualizing which city has the most and least location type affected by rats and which of those locations are active or not. To do so i grouped the location types and selected the status of those location types. To map the color i used city to distinguish where they were located.Brooklyn has the most variety in location type (for the few sample selected) affected by rats compared to Staten Island Bayside and Ridge wood which have the least.
Plot 3:
For plot 3 i wanted a map visual representation of the Assigned status in Brooklyn specifically. to do this i simply filltered the location status to "Assigned" in the city " Brooklyn"
Story:
There are rats invasions in Newyork's cities, most of them are in Brookly while few to non of them are in Staten Island Bayside and Ridge wood. The ones with the most invasions are closed whilse others are still pending in review or assigned.
