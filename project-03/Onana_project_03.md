# Data Visualization Project 03
The goal of this project was to explore methods to create different types of data visualizations (such as plotting text data, or exploring the distributions of continuous variables).
Plot1: 
Use to replicate a data set image through the lubridate package such that the maximum temperature each month was visualized (histogram)
Plot2: 
Use to replicate a data set image to compare the density with the temperature. 
Plot3: 
Use to replicate a data set image through the lubridate package such that the maximum temperature each month was visualized (geom_density)
Plot 4: 
Use to replicate a data set image to compare the temperature levels per month. This one required converting the months' digit to names
Plot 5: 
Create a visual plot of precipitation per month
Plot 6: 
Create a visualtext of music song titles
